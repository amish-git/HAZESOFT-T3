- Here, I have created a simple backup script which can be used to backup files.
- We take a single argument of the source folder as we run the script that needs to be back up.
- We can use different compresion mechanism such as gzip,bzip,xz.But in my script, I have used the gzip mechanism.
- To run the script file,use ./<script-name>.sh /path/to/source/file , you have to provide the source file to be backed up and the location where you want to back up this source file.
- Then you will be informed if the backup has been successful or not in the promt.
